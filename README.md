# EEGPong
Arduino and Visual studio code necessary to play EEG Pong
Arduino zero code takes input through Analog0 input pin and communicates with computer over usb through program pin
Visual studio code needs opengl and several other libraries: glad , glfw3 , fftw3 , stdio , stdlib . 
The Visual studio code should be started after the Arduino is running
I used Ag/AgCl sintered electrodes and elecectrode gel, however an inexpensive alternative are gold electrodes, four are preffered but it can be used with 3 if you leave one of the biases unconnected. Aloe vera is a possible substitute for eeg gel, however you only need a small amount of gel and it is relatively cheap. 
The board designs were done in Eagle and assembled in house at my university, however PCBworld is my preffered manufacturer otherwise.
